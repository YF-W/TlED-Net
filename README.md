### **Triple-loop Encoder-Decoder Architecture Based Semantic Segmentation Network With Dense Skip Connections**

1. We proposed a novel network architecture and experimentally validated its superiority in certain aspects while discussing its limitations.

2.  Employing various representation strategies to reconstruct a variant of this architecture for building the backbone of TlED-Net.

3. Enhancing the network's capacity of feature fusion through dense skip connections.

4. Constructed a novel dual attention mechanism and embedded it according to the architectural characteristics of the network.

5. Optimized the deep-level structures.
